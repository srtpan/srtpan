### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Shruti, a data nerd who went to Duke to geek out more about ~~basketball~~ data! 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at CVS Health, leading their GenAI initiatives to reduce time-to-market strategies for Caremark. I work intensively with prescription data and support underwriters with pricing, forecasting utilization, and AI integration. Previously, I worked at Nationwide as an internal consultant for the annuities department, supporting them with AI integration, underwriting, and competitive landscaping. 


ðŸŒ± In the data world, my current explorations are hardware AI integrations and women's health. 


ðŸ˜„ Outside of work, you will find me cooking, binging on podcasts, or reading a cozy book in a cute corner of my home
